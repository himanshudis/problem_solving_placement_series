15.Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

Example:

Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

class Solution(object):
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
        s=set();
        c=0;
        abc=0;
        for i in nums:
            s.add(i);
        for i in nums:
            c=1;
            if(i-1 not in s):
                k=i;
                while(k+1 in s):
                    c=c+1;
                    k=k+1;
                abc=max(c,abc)
        return abc
