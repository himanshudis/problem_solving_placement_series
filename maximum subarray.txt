maximum subarray

5.Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:

Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

class Solution(object):
    def maxSubArray(self, nums):
        sum1=0;
        ans=nums[0];
        for i in nums:
            sum1=sum1+i;
            if(ans<sum1):
                ans=sum1;
            if(sum1<0):
                sum1=0;
        return ans
